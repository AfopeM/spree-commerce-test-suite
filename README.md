# Spree Commerce API Test Automation

**Risk-based API testing suite** for the Spree Commerce e-commerce platform, demonstrating test prioritization, architectural patterns, and CI/CD integration.

**Core Focus:** Revenue-critical checkout flow and cart operations, the features that drive **80% of business value.**

## Testing Strategy: Risk-Based Prioritization

Test coverage is driven by **business impact.** On e-commerce platforms, cart and checkout failures translate directly to lost revenue, so that's where the suite is focused first.

| Feature Area        | Business Impact                                  | Priority  | Coverage Rationale                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | :-------: | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Checkout Flow**   | Direct revenue — any failure stops a purchase    |  🔴 High  | Full purchase path: address → shipping → payment → confirmation |
| **Cart Operations** | Blocks checkout — broken cart causes abandonment | 🟡 Medium | Add, update, and remove operations including edge cases         |

**Out Of Scope:** Product Catalog, Wishlists, and Admin APIs

## Test Coverage

| Suite                           | Positive | Negative | Edge |     Total     |
| ------------------------------- | :------: | :------: | :--: | :-----------: |
| **Cart** (`tests/cart`)         |    5     |    7     |  2   |    **14**     |
| **Checkout** (`tests/checkout`) |    —     |    —     |  —   | _In Progress_ |
| **Total**                       |    5     |    7     |  2   |    **14**     |

## Key Design Decisions

**Dynamic product IDs:** Purchasable variant IDs are fetched at runtime rather than hardcoded. This prevents flaky tests in environments where inventory changes frequently, which is the norm in e-commerce.

**Isolated cart tokens per test:** Every test creates its own cart token, ensuring zero state bleed between tests even under full parallel execution.

**Explicit error contract validation:** The suite distinguishes between `404 Not Found` (resource doesn't exist) and `422 Unprocessable Entity` (business logic failure, e.g. out-of-stock). This boundary matters — front-end error handling depends on getting the right status code to show the right message to the user.
